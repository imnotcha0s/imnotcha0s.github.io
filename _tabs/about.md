i'm Cha0s (even though the url says the opposite), a cybersecurity researcher,(should i even say bughunter? lmao) and CTF player.

My goal with this blog is to document my journey while i evolve in the cybersec world, mostly posting about HTB boxes, a few of my pentesting insights/techniques and (maybe) bug bounty findings.
