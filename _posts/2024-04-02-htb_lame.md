First of all i've started scanning with nmap.

We get a few ports open, so we'll first take a look at ftp since it got anonymous login enabled, then smb.
# Inspecting ftp
---
After logging in ftp, we won't find anything, but after i've seen the server banner i imediately knew that it was a vulnerable server (vsFTPd 2.3.4), so it was time to exploit.

I launched metasploit, found the exploit, selected it, setted up everyting....

First, i took at look with smbclient, it also had anonymous login, but no valuable files on its shares.

After searching for the samba version i found a vulnerability and a metasploit module!

So it was time for exploit the machine and...

Root!! 

Since we already got root we just needed to find the flags that were in the home directory of a user and root (respectively)
