# ~$ Whoami
---

i'm Cha0s (even though the url says the opposite), a cybersecurity researcher,(should i even say bughunter? lmao) and CTF player. 

Since i'm not giving y'all free intel about me i rather talk a bit about my purpose here

# -$ echo $MY_PURPOSE
---

My goal with this blog is to document my journey while i evolve in the cybersec world, mostly posting about HTB boxes, a few of my pentesting insights/techniques and (maybe) bug bounty findings.
